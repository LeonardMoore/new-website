<p>"Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom."
  -<strong><em>Nikola Tesla</em></strong>

    <h2>Crazy facts about space</h2>
      <p>For the most part space is amazing and always has us thinking about what else is out there, but, there are other parts of space that are down right terrifying and has us being thankfull about our very own shield that is our earth's atmosphere. From planets with extreme conditions to big astronomical events these are just some of the things to remind us to keep our guard up.<p>

          <li>Kepler is so close to its star it's definitely scorched and is the reason it's thought to be airless.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Fast radio bursts (FBR) are powerful blasts of radio waves that last just a few milliseconds and strange radio signals from space are still baffling astronomers with their odd behaviour.</li>
            <li>They belch out across the cosmos without any rhyme or reason, with no discernible pattern, making them increadibly hard to study.</li>
            <li>Some of these bursts have been seen to repeat, flickering on and off many times from the same point in space.</li>

              <li>The size of a neutron star is about the same size as Montreal (usually) and cramming the mass of a sun or two inside, that incredible density of material can give rise to some pretty strange phenomena.</li>

            <li>Dark matter is material that cannot be seen directly.</li>
            <li>We know that dark matter exists because of the effect it has on objects that we can observe directly.</li>

        <li>Most Bizarre Star</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The star KIC 8462853 or simply Tabby's star has displayed some unusual dimming behavior, but has been shown to get brighter on ocasion.</li>
            <li>The mysteries haven't been solved yet, but scientists are busy working on teasing out the star's secrets. Wednesday, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory highlighted some new information on Tabby's Star that cites dust as the most likely reason for its dimming trend.</li>
            <li>The study, lead by University of Arizona, Tucson, astronomer Huan Meng, points to an uneven orbiting dust cloud and describes a smoking gun: "Researchers found less dimming in the infrared light from the star than in its ultraviolet light. Any object larger than dust particles would dim all wavelengths of light equally when passing in front of Tabby's Star."
            This will come as a disappointment to fans of the alien-megastructure theory, though scientists won't rule out other possible exlanations.</li>
