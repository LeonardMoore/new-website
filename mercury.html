  <h2>Merury is closest to the sun</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, has been studied by multiply spacecraft throughout the years. Scientists have uncovered some amazing findings about the small planet and have even mapped its entire surface and found that it has the most extreme temperature fluctuations in the solar system. Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface can still be extremely cold. the temperature during the day can reach 450 degrees Celsius (840 degrees Fahrenheit), but at night, temperatures can get as low as -170 C (-275 F). That fluctuation equals a temperature sweing of more than 600 C (1,100 F), the largest of any planet in the solar system.

  <h2>The Smallest Planet</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. The diminutive planet is about 4,876 km in diameter, making it slightly bigger than Earth's moon. It's smaller than both Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Pluto used to be considered the smallest planet in the solar system, but it was downgraded to a "dwarf planet", leaving the distinctioin to Mercury.

  <h2>Survived Impact with Giant Asteroid</h2>
    <p>
      Scientists think that a huge asteroid slammed into Mercury about 4 billion years ago, creating a giant crater about 1,545 km (960 miles) across. Called the Calois Basin, the crater could fit the whole state of Texas inside it. Researchers have calculated that the asteroid that created the basin hadd to have been about 100km (60 miles) wide.

  <h2>Mercurty's Crazy Fast Orbit</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury zips around the sun faster than any other planet. It travels about 180,000 km/h (112,000 mph) along its elliptical orbit. The planet gets as close as 47 million km (29 million miles) to the sun, and as distant as 70 million km (43 million miles) from the sun. The planet takes only 88 Earth days to completely orbit the sun.
